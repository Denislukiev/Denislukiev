- 👋 Hi, I'm @Denislukiev. I prefer programming in python
- 👀 I am interested in creating applications, utilities and many other things that simplify life. Programming in python, java, javaScript, C#, php.
- 🌱 I'm currently studying what kind of interesting projects I can create for people.
- 💞️ I want to cooperate with people, companies, who are interested in my ideas and who need to simplify some action.
- 📫 How to contact me via email (but I rarely go to it), so now I will actively think how to create some interesting place where you can discuss everything. but at the moment it is better to write to the mail.
- ⚡ Interesting fact: I study programming since 2022.
